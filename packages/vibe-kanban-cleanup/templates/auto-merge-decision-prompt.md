# Evaluation Criteria

Analyze the PR against the following criteria and provide a thorough assessment:

## 1. Code Quality Assessment
- **Code Structure**: Is the code well-organized, following established patterns?
- **Readability**: Is the code clear and self-documenting?
- **Best Practices**: Does it follow language/framework conventions?
- **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance concerns?
- **Security**: Are there potential security vulnerabilities?

## 2. Testing Coverage
- **Test Completeness**: Are all new features/changes covered by tests?
- **Test Quality**: Are tests meaningful and well-written?
- **Test Results**: Do all tests pass consistently?
- **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases and error conditions tested?

## 3. Breaking Changes Assessment
- **API Changes**: Are there any breaking changes to public APIs?
- **Database Changes**: Are there schema changes that require migration?
- **Configuration**: Are there changes to configuration that affect deployment?
- **Dependencies**: Are there dependency updates that might cause issues?

## 4. Risk Analysis
- **Scope of Changes**: How extensive are the changes?
- **Critical Path Impact**: Do changes affect critical system functionality?
- **Rollback Difficulty**: How easy would it be to revert if issues arise?
- **Production Impact**: What's the potential impact on production systems?

## 5. Compliance Checks
- **Type Safety**: Are there TypeScript/type checking errors?
- **Linting**: Are there linting violations that indicate code quality issues?
- **Build Status**: Does the code build successfully?
- **Documentation**: Is necessary documentation updated?

# Decision Framework

## ‚úÖ MERGE CONDITIONS (All must be true)
- [ ] All tests pass (including unit, integration, and e2e tests)
- [ ] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] No critical linting errors (warnings may be acceptable)
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] No breaking changes without proper migration strategy
- [ ] Code follows established patterns and conventions
- [ ] Adequate test coverage for new/modified functionality
- [ ] No obvious security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Changes align with the stated task/requirements
- [ ] Risk level is LOW or MEDIUM with proper mitigation

## ‚ùå DO NOT MERGE CONDITIONS (Any one is sufficient to block)
- [ ] Any test failures
- [ ] TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Critical linting errors that indicate bugs
- [ ] Build failures
- [ ] Unaddressed breaking changes
- [ ] Missing tests for new functionality
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities detected
- [ ] Code quality issues that affect maintainability
- [ ] Changes don't match the task requirements
- [ ] HIGH risk level without adequate review
- [ ] Incomplete implementation (TODO comments, placeholder code)
- [ ] Dependencies with known security issues
