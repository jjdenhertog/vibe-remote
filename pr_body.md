Title: Add configurator to web-config

Description:read docs/goal/01-project-overview.md and docs/goal/02-preference-system.md. This will give you a good overview of the goal we try to reach.

Now focus on @apps/web to create a UI where a user can modify the preference files. Please use the monaco editor for react. Take your time to build this, it requires quite soms effort to do it right.

Before you complete the task make sure to run 
pnpm -r run type-check
pnpm -r run lint

Fix any error you find, but leave the warnings as is.
