Title: [AI] Implement PR merge execution with gh CLI

Description:**Priority: MEDIUM**
**Dependencies: None**

Implement a simple fallback PR merge function for "always merge" mode:

1. **Create merge function** at `packages/vibe-kanban-cleanup/src/functions/mergePullRequest.ts`:
   - Accept PR URL as parameter
   - Execute `gh pr merge --squash --body "Auto-merged by vibe-kanban" --delete-branch`
   - Suppress and ignore worktree checkout errors (expected behavior)
   - Return merge status

2. **Implement error handling**:
   - Catch gh CLI errors and categorize them
   - Specifically suppress worktree-related checkout errors
   - Log merge attempts with timestamps
   - Return success/failure status

3. **Keep it simple**:
   - This is only used when auto-merge mode is "always" (not Claude decision)
   - No complex logic needed - just execute the merge command
   - Focus on reliable execution and error suppression

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Successfully merges PR using gh CLI with squash strategy
- Properly suppresses worktree checkout errors
- Returns clear success/failure status
- Simple implementation for "always merge" modeYour goal is to code review the current project before a PR is being created.

## Analysis Requirements
1. **Assess the codebase thoroughly**
2. **Analyze everything file by file** 
3. **Determine how well the task was executed**

## Review Criteria
- Code quality and adherence to standards
- No over engineering
- Everything in the task should be implemented

## Action Items

If the task was not executed well, you should:

- **Fix any errors** you find necessary
- **Improve code quality** where needed
- **Add missing functionality** to complete the task
- **Enhance error handling** and validation
